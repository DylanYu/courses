Using provided trace:

Typical Noise: -90 dBm
Max Signal: -44 dBm
Min Signal: -69 dBm

So the min SNR 29 dB and max SNR is 46 dB, max is roughly 100 times of min.

For different kinds of frames (beacon, ack, data), the trasmission rate 
varies (1, 24, 36, 54 Mb/s ... Typically Management (broadcast/beacon) < 
Control (ack) < Data.


There are:
1783 Data frames and the most common subtype is 0,
1391 Control frames (ack) and the most common subtype is 13,
557 Management frames (beacon) and the most common subtype is 8.

353 data frames are retransmitted, 1430 are not. So the retransmissions 
over the number of original transmissions is 0.247.

16 frames from client to AP indicates entering power saving 
state, with 822 frames from client to AP in total, the fraction is 1.95%.

The SSID of the main AP is djw. Beacon frame interval is 0.102400 s.
Date rates supported by AP is 1/2/5.5/11(B)/18/24//36/54(M).
Beacon frame transmisson rate is 1 Mbps.

Type/Subtype of Association Request / Response is 0 0 / 0 1,
of Probe Request / Response is 0 4 / 0 5.
