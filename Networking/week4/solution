1.  What are the IP addresses of your computer and the remote server? 

...

2.  Does the Total Length field include the IP header plus IP payload, or just the IP payload? 

IP headeris included.

3.  How does the value of the Identification field change or stay the same for different packets? For 
instance, does it hold the same value for all packets in a TCP connection or does it differ for each 
packet? Is it the same in both directions? Can you see any pattern if the value does change? 

Identification field differs for each packet. Not same in both directions.
The value is increased by one for each packet roughly, in one direction.

4.  What is the initial value of the TTL field for packets sent from your computer? Is it the maximum 
possible value, or some lower value?  

64. Not the maximum possible value (256).

5.  How can you tell from looking at a packet that it has not been fragmented? Most often IP pack-
ets in normal operation are not fragmented. But the receiver must have a way to be sure. Hint: 
you may need to read your text to confirm a guess. 

From the More Fragments bit.

6.  What is the length of the IP Header and how is this encoded in the header length field? Hint: no-
tice that only 4 bits are used for this field, as the version takes up the other 4 bits of the byte. 
You may guess and check your text. 

The length of IP header is 20 bytes. The IHL field is encoded by 32 bits (4 bytes) as a unit, so the value is 5.
